I found this video last night by [Torben Hoffman](LeHoff), I recommend folks interested in Erlang or Elixir give it a watch and take it to heart.  Torben does a good job of displaying how an "Erlanger" should think, in comparison to other programmers.

Torben recommends 2 books which have been added to my reading list:

[Communicating Sequential Processes](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Communicating-Sequential-Processes-International-Computing/dp/0131532715) by C.A.R. Hoare.

[Principles of Protocol Design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Protocol-Design-Robin-Sharp/dp/3540775404) by Robin Sharp.
