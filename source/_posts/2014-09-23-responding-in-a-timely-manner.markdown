Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to attend [ReactConf](http://reactconf.com) in London, this was one of the sessions. In an earlier post I spoke of how you should should check out [Martin Thompson](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk)'s videos as they are the proverbial a gold mine of knowledge on building fast and scalable systems.

In this talk Martin defines different levels of "Real Time", touching on the importance of being responsive and practical tools and advice to achieve that in the real world.

The talk is broken into the following sections:

1. How to Test and Measure
2. A little bit of Theory
3. A little bit of Practice
4. Common Pitfalls
5. Useful Algorithms and Techniques
