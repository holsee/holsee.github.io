I recently got into a conversation about the computer science classic *sorting*, in particular we chatted about applications of Radix Sort. 

{% pullquote %}
This is not something I had really needed to look into in any detail, but sparked my interest due to this statement {""Radix sorts are often, in practice, the fastest and most useful sorts on parallel machines.""}
{% endpullquote %}

The spark rekindled my desire for refreshing my knowledge of the basics so I may build on this to explore the latest and greatest research in this area.

I personally like the MIT course [Introduction to Algorithms](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/) as it covers so many of the fundamentals very well.

Watching "Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Lower Bounds for Sorting" at the minute:

A good start for now.

Also worth checking out: ["Practical Applications of Radix Sort"](http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12223/practical-applications-of-radix-sort).
