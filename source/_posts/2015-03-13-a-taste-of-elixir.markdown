I recently gave a presentation to [Functional Kats (Belfast)](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Kats-Belfast/) on the elixir language.  It was a lot of fun!

The format of the event I totally love, it started with a couple of talks followed by a Kata hack where we all had a go at implementing the Luhn Credit Card algo in the functional programming language of our choice.  At the end we all took turns to present our solutions.

The goal of my talk was to arm the folks with enough of the basics to implement the Kata in elixir.
