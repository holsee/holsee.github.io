    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pretty cool that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx">.NET got open sourced</a>, even more cool is that it is MIT license with the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet">Source Code on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Also pretty funky that they are offering a fully featured version of Visual Studio for free and shipping supported Linux and OS X runtimes.  Mono has give us this for a long time, but it is a nice that the gaps in Mono are going to be filled.</p>

<p>Lots of cool stuff coming in this area, such as the new Roslyn compiler (C# written in C# now not C++) which will open up some crazy compiler as a service meta-programming voodoo.  Mono is a C# implementation of C# and has again been ahead of its time in this space, but Roslyn seems to be generating some crazy buzz around code introspection and IDE features.</p>

<p>Most interesting thing in .NET space for me though is not any of this but is simply the F# language, which itself is written in F#, and has been the most pioneering and exciting language in the .NET space for a number of years due to its ability to innovate a add new powerful features with relative ease.</p>

<p>I hope that C# and .NET keep pushing forward and we don&rsquo;t see a Java-&lsquo;6-8&rsquo;-esk stagnation period. Doesn&rsquo;t look like it in week one anyway &ndash;> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/20/one-week-of-open-source.aspx">&lsquo;One Week of Open Source&rsquo;</a>&hellip;</p>
