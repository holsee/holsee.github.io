    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think brushing up on Computer Science fundamentals from time to time is a valuable endeavour, which every developer should do.</p>

<p>Even if it is as little as taking one of the many <a href="/mit-introduction-to-algorithms/">undergrad level modules online</a>.  Many of which are not to be sniffed at.</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>My Sister is a doctor, and soon she will be revalidated: &ldquo;<em>Revalidation is the process by which doctors holding registration with a licence to practise will have to demonstrate to the GMC that they are up-to-date and fit to practise and complying with the relevant professional standards.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for what her day to day is like, but as a practicing doctor I doubt you exercise you entire base of knowledge on a regular enough basis to avoid refreshing yourself with the fundamentals from time to time.</p>

<p>Now imagine beyond doing our daily duties, developers were required to go through such a &ldquo;revalidation&rdquo; process in order to be allowed to hold the title of software engineer (or whatever).</p>

<p>An interesting thought&hellip; baring in mind we all probably know at least one <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/on-secretly-terrible-engineers/">Secretly Terrible Engineer</a>.</p>

<p>Ours is a industry fueled by both passion and science, and the passion is what has pushed us forward.  The same can be said for medicine.</p>

<p>Bad engineers probably were not always that way, maybe they were both sharp and passionate as a they come when they started, but the lack of inspiration in their 9 to 5 has caused them to become blunt and disenchanted over time.</p>

<p>It is often said software development is so broad and someone cannot possibly know everything, true, but I don&rsquo;t think medicine is a small field and there is no excuse for a Doctor to not be continually up-to-date with the fundamentals of their field as well as their respective specialization.</p>

<p>I for one don&rsquo;t like the idea of being made to &ldquo;Revalidate&rdquo;, but I do think we owe it to ourselves to try and stay fresh and up-to-date with the foundations of our industry.</p>
