    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found this video last night by <a href="LeHoff">Torben Hoffman</a>, I recommend folks interested in Erlang or Elixir give it a watch and take it to heart.  Torben does a good job of displaying how an &ldquo;Erlanger&rdquo; should think, in comparison to other programmers.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/118258580 "></iframe></div>


<p>Torben recommends 2 books which have been added to my reading list:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf">Communicating Sequential Processes</a> by C.A.R. Hoare. (Free digital Version)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>As I plan to write and speak about Elixir on my blog and hopefully at some meet-ups soon, I though I would write a short post with handy descriptions of some of the key aspects that I can reference in one place&hellip;</em></p>

<h3>What is Elixir?</h3>

<p>Think Dave Thomas describes it best&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Elixir Programming Language wraps functional programming with immutable state and an actor-based approach to concurrency in a tidy modern syntax.  And it runs on the industrial-strength, high-performance, distributed Erlang VM.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has very powerful meta-programming capabilities through compile time expansion of macros and the dynamic power of the language.  A good example of the developer productivity that can be gained is their use in the <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/v0.7.2/docs/routing">routing system in the phoenix web framework</a>. When learning about Elixir macros I found the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.theerlangelist.com/2014/06/understanding-elixir-macros-part-1.html">Understanding Elixir Macros Series</a>&rsquo; by <a href="https://twitter.com/sasajuric">Saša Jurić</a> to be very useful.</p>

<h3>What is the Erlang VM &amp; BEAM?</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;Erlang VM&rdquo; is the name of the virtual machine where all Erlang code is executed. Every compiled Erlang file has the suffix .beam.</p>

<p>There is also an implementation of Erlang which runs on the JVM, called <a href="https://github.com/krestenkrab/erjang/wiki">Erjang</a>, but I guess the less said about that the better as the Erlang VM is really the awesome part if you ask me.</p>

<p>When you compile Elixir code it is converted to .beam format, which allows it to be executed on the Erlang VM.</p>

<h3>What is OTP?</h3>

<p>OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging and release handling tools.</p>

<p>The OTP libraries (and the associated best practices to an extent) are mature, battle hardened and hide much of the boilerplate code required to perform common patterns such as creating a server to store state, recover from failures through supervision trees and so much more.</p>

<p>I look forward to writing about this with examples in future as I learn more about OTP myself.</p>

<p><em>Where is OTP used?</em></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/egitd">egitsd</a> &ndash; egitd is an Erlang git-daemon implementation that provides a more flexible,
scalable, and loggable way to serve public git repositories.  It is used by github.com.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> &ndash; An open source message broker (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pretty cool that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx">.NET got open sourced</a>, even more cool is that it is MIT license with the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet">Source Code on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Also pretty funky that they are offering a fully featured version of Visual Studio for free and shipping supported Linux and OS X runtimes.  Mono has give us this for a long time, but it is a nice that the gaps in Mono are going to be filled.</p>

<p>Lots of cool stuff coming in this area, such as the new Roslyn compiler (C# written in C# now not C++) which will open up some crazy compiler as a service meta-programming voodoo.  Mono is a C# implementation of C# and has again been ahead of its time in this space, but Roslyn seems to be generating some crazy buzz around code introspection and IDE features.</p>

<p>Most interesting thing in .NET space for me though is not any of this but is simply the F# language, which itself is written in F#, and has been the most pioneering and exciting language in the .NET space for a number of years due to its ability to innovate a add new powerful features with relative ease.</p>

<p>I hope that C# and .NET keep pushing forward and we don&rsquo;t see a Java-&lsquo;6-8&rsquo;-esk stagnation period. Doesn&rsquo;t look like it in week one anyway &ndash;> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/20/one-week-of-open-source.aspx">&lsquo;One Week of Open Source&rsquo;</a>&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Completed the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-testing-for-zombies">Rails Testing <em>for zombies</em></a> courses on <a href="http://mbsy.co/8TZ9N">CodeSchool</a> tonight.</p>

<p>I liked it, I always found starting a new rails app always triggered my testing OCD and it was nice to get an insight into the strategies one can take to test a rails app without overdoing it.</p>

<p><img src="http://holsee.github.io/images/badges/rtfz_badge.png"></p>

<p>The course covers how to unit test and integration test your rails app with fixtures using TestUnit, so you are given a good idea of the tools at your disposal out of the box. As a well as that you are introduced to other popular testing gems which make your life easier such as <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">Shoulda</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a>.  I will touch on each of there briefly to give you a taste of what they are all about&hellip;</p>

<p>During the Unit Testing section you are introduced to <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">Shoulda</a> gem which is described as an alternative syntax that is easy on the fingers and the eyes.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As the course starts to dig into integration testing you are also introduced to <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> which provides a interaction based DSL for defining your integration tests that supports <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara#Drivers">multiple drivers</a>. Capybara tests when executing act like a headless browser of sorts giving you more control over the interactions with your site or api, following redirects more naturally for example which is something not handles by vanilla rails integration tests so well.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Lastly you are introduced to <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a>, which is an alternative to using the built in test fixtures provided by rails out of the box.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are numerous advantages to using a factories and specifically FactoryGirl instead of the built in rails fixture for your test data. You are provided with granular control over how the test data built and initialized not to mention the ability to create test data dynamically rather than maintaining a complex hand crafted static data set defined in yaml with magic ids providing the only basis for associations.</p>

<p>Using the <code>Factory</code> method directly will create an instance of an admin and insert it into the DB.</p>

<p>Beyond this basic example you are able to create new instances without inserting them into the database using the <code>build</code> method on the Factory as well as defining associations between entities as simple as adding <code>association :foo</code>.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Insights into a good test strategy that I took away was to unit test the model and have a full suite of integration tests for everything else, which regards to the rails portion of your application anyway, keep your controllers and views logic free.</p>

<p>This is the approach that I had taken with a node.js app I have been writing, although I have been hand crafting the test data code I think I will look for something like FactoryGirl maybe <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/factory-girl">this javcascript port</a>.</p>

<p>So thats another course completed, and was well worth the time, not a bad way to spend some of your Sunday afternoon. I think I might do the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r">Try R</a> course next or some <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-ember-js">Ember.js</a> which I can put to use in the near future as I am design a website for my wife to kick start a new business idea we have.</p>

    <link href="http://holsee.github.io/integrated-tests-are-a-scam/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-18T23:04:51+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://holsee.github.io/integrated-tests-are-a-scam</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Found this gem in a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/david_whitney">@david_whitney</a>, and as he says the title is trolly but none the less is an excellent talk on automated testing.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/80533536 "></iframe></div>


<h3>Integrations Tests Lead to Bad Design</h3>

<ul>
<li>An interesting point is made (and I am paraphrasing) that the more integration tests we have the less design feedback we get, leading to sloppy design as we don&rsquo;t feel the same feedback &amp; design pressure&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Failed and Where?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Integration tests may highlight failures, and the name of the test may go a long way to saying what failed, but pin pointing the actual location and reason for the failure is often lost in the generalization of the test itself.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<h3>The Systemic Growth of Integration Tests</h3>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;[they&rsquo;re] like taking aspirin that make your headache worse&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Given 3 components which each interact with each other, how many tests would we need to cover all code paths?</li>
</ul>


<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Component  </th>
<th> # Paths  </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     A      </td>
<td>     3    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     B      </td>
<td>     5    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     C      </td>
<td>     7    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>3 x 5 x 7 = 105 Integration Tests*</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a 4th subsystem, as a result of a refactoring, with 2 paths removed from C moved into Component D:</li>
</ul>


<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Component  </th>
<th> # Paths  </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     A      </td>
<td>     3    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     B      </td>
<td>     5    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     C      </td>
<td>     5    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>     D      </td>
<td>     2    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>3 x 5 x 5 x 2 = 150 Integration Tests*</p>

<p>*At Least as to cover all code paths.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is an example of <em>negative design pressure</em>, specifically in this instance to refactoring, which itself is important to obtaining good design.</li>
<li>Resulting in another 45 tests being created and a on going cost of the time it will take to execute these tests.</li>
<li>Not to mention the time it takes to run these tests hardly lends itself to a rapid Red Green Refactor cycle that would be possible with more isolated tests.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Solution</h3>

    <id>http://holsee.github.io/devlog-ruby-bits-1-and-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Completed the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">RUBY BITS</a> courses on <a href="http://mbsy.co/8TZ9N">CodeSchool</a>. Again&hellip; I was impressed with the content, as a casual rubyist I got plenty out of doing this.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this course, I took away a lot of useful idioms which I will put to good use (when I get the chance).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://holsee.github.io/images/badges/ruby-bits_badge.png" width="538" height="178"></p>

<p>The meta-programming a DSL creation in <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits-part-2">RUBY BITS part 2</a> were great&hellip; adding methods to classes dynamically is pretty bad-ass for drying up code.</p>

<p><em>I always wanted default method implementation on interfaces in C#, dunno why I brought this up other than in Ruby that would never ever be an issue with the features you have at your disposal&hellip; very few languages lead to as much developer happiness.</em></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://holsee.github.io/images/badges/ruby-bits-2_badge.png" width="538" height="178"></p>

<p>Just one of those languages I would love to write everyday if I could.
Moving onto <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-testing-for-zombies">Rails Testing <em>for zombies</em></a> course next&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;that said <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir has hit v1.x</a> and the Dave Thomas <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir">&ldquo;Programming Elixir&rdquo;</a> book has been released, so that will most likely eat up the next month or two of my life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Completed the <a href="">Real Time Web with Node.js course on CodeSchool</a></p>

<p><img src="http://holsee.github.io/images/badges/rtnode_badge.png"></p>

<p>Another impeccable course, produced to the usual  high standards which I have come to expect with each and every CodeSchool module. Go give these guys money and do a few courses, worth every penny.</p>

<p>I have completed a couple of node.js projects to date and am currently working on a biggin&#8217;, so I didn&rsquo;t find this course very challenging, but I did find it fun, another great jingle and lots of great content.</p>

<p>The examples go a long way to show how much you can do with so little code, walking students through using <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> and <a href="http://redis.io">redis</a> to build a chat client and a Q&amp;A system.</p>

<p>Something I learned was how to use redis effectively, the course got me started and provided useful tips such as limiting size of a list to 10 items for example:</p>

    <link href="http://holsee.github.io/devlog-what-ive-been-learning/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://holsee.github.io/devlog-what-ive-been-learning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These last few months I have been learning more than usual and in this post I talk a little about some of the things that have caught my interest.  All of this is outside of work as my day job is working on a Trading platform written in C#.</p>

<p>Another goal of this post is to kick start my blogging again which I have completely got out of the way of doing over the last 2 or so years.</p>

<h3>Erlang &amp; Elixir</h3>

<p>Partially inspired by my functional programming binge and a chat I had with <a href="http://joearms.github.io">Joe Armstrong</a> at <a href="http://reactconf.com">ReactConf</a>; I have been getting stuck into Erlang, <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix">Phoenix web framework</a>.</p>

<p>I feel these will play a big part in my future.  The BEAM VM is fascinating and the powerful distributed programming model via the OTP libraries is something different and interesting.  I look forward to digging into these topics on my blog in the coming months as I become more familiar with them.</p>

<p>I am working on an &lsquo;anonymous&rsquo; location broadcast server to use these technologies in anger and I have found this has helped me achieve those A-HA moments that are so important when it comes to learning something and making it stick.</p>

<h3>Node.js</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working away on a personal project (which will be launched at outloud.io some time in the future) using node.js, express.js, postgreSQL, passport.js, mocha, chai, chai-as-promised, Q, db-migrate, node-env&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have had this idea for a while, and I got pretty excited about building it.  At the time I was looking for a good excuse to get stuck into a substantial project which was built on node.js.  Even though I have used JS for years I have learned a great deal about the node way, building stuff tis the best way to learn it is no secret.</p>

<h3>Ruby and Rails</h3>

<p>I completed a MOOC course on Coursera on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications">Web Application Architectures</a> which used Ruby &amp; Rails recently.  Was very much entry level stuff, got through it in about 2 days and I think anybody with significant web dev experiences would find the same thing.  I guess it showed me that I knew more than I thought about Ruby and Rails and needed to focus on more advanced and newer topics.</p>

<p>I have been slowly but surely learning Ruby for the past 4 years and I find it lots of fun.  I used to subscribe and watch the <a href="http://www.rubytapas.com">Ruby Tapas</a> episodes which are brilliant, but because I wasn&rsquo;t using it in my day job for anything more than Chef scripts I never really got to go deep.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codewars.com/about">Codewars.com</a> stole quite a few of my evenings, a great way to learn or get better using a language by solving a katas (with tests) then seeing how others solved the same problems in a potentially more idiomatic way.  Each solution is rated by the community on &lsquo;how smart&rsquo; and &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>I plan to dig into the latest version of Rails for Zombies on Code School and keep going to the <a href="http://belfastruby.com">Belfast Ruby</a> meet-ups.</p>

<h3>Objective-C</h3>

<p>I worked as a &ldquo;mobile developer&rdquo; and have built a few apps over the last number of years in various technologies such as Obj-C, Java (Android), C# Xamarin (targeting both iOS and Android) and some PoCs using Phonegap.</p>

<p>But I never felt I got to use Objective-C to the extent I wanted to, as the performance, the sexy runtime dispatch and the CocoaTouch libs intrigued.  A friend of mine who now works at Apple once told me the Cocoa libraries were examples of some of the nicest Object Oriented programming he had ever seen.  This has always made me want to know more.</p>

<p>My employer sent me on an Objective-C course few months back which was nice of them since I don&rsquo;t even use it in my current day job.</p>

<p>As I said, apple dev has always interested me so I have read a couple of books and completed numerous little projects.</p>

<p>Right now I am working through the iOS Code School path and building and iOS client for the location broadcast server I spoke about in the Elixir section above.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind working on iOS again&hellip; which leads me into&hellip;</p>

<h3>Swift 1.0</h3>

<p>XCode 6.0.1 has been dropped and now I have Swift to play with :D. I didn&rsquo;t have my own Apple dev license so I had to wait.  I did pretty much read the iBook cover to cover in the interim.</p>

<p>If I am to ever transition into this area, I would like to do so where I can hit the ground running so I might start to port the Objective-C location client to swift (or maybe just parts of it to get used to the interop).</p>

<h3>Data Structure &amp; Algorithms</h3>

<p>I always try to keep a balance of new technologies/language and CS theory.   Right now I do have a desire to spend more time reading up on Data Structures and Algorithms and their application to big problems.  This is the stuff that you learn and is timeless, and there is plenty of it to get stuck into!</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to do the <a href="http://instil.co/courses/writing-concurrent-code-with-lock-free-algorithms/">&lsquo;Writing Concurrent Code with Lock-Free Algorithms&rsquo; course</a> by <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk">Martin Thompson</a> and I got to hear him speak a couple of weeks ago at the End of Summer Bash event&hellip; if you haven&rsquo;t watched one of his talks please take the time to do so <a href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Martin-Thompson">(now)</a>.</p>

<p>The big take away for me is the fastest, most elegant and performant solutions, come from  using the most appropriate, hand crafted, intelligently selected data structures and algorithms to solve the problem over picking up general purpose tools.</p>

<p>There is so much more in this area that I want to talk about but not in this post&hellip; but definitely add <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk">Mechanical Sympathy</a> to your blog reader.</p>

<h3>Functional &amp; Reactive Programming</h3>

<p>I completed the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming Principles in Scala</a>, a MOOC on Coursera.  Before that I completed the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Reactive Programming</a> course.  These were very good, humbling, challenging and rewarding.</p>

<p>I have been using RX in .NET for years which helped a lot but I still found the Reactive course very worth while.  Both these courses use Scala and I enjoyed getting to learn it a bit better.  I liked how the reactive programming course built up concepts in layers, starting with getting the students to build a priority queue and finishing with reactive system using the <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a> actor model.</p>

<h3>Some Books: Remote, Rework &amp; Lean Start-up</h3>

<p>In the last 6 months I have read these books each twice (well I used audible so they were read to me twice). Wonderful books which resonated with me on so many levels.  They are informative and practical guides which are also quite inspiring.</p>

<p>I think I really got inspired to start developing outloud.io through my desire to just start something of my own from reading <a href="http://theleanstartup.com">The Lean Startup</a>.</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>As a senior engineer I teach as part of my job, but recently I have been helping my buddy who is learning to program.</p>

<p>This is a different challenge altogether, starting from the basics and helping to set the mindset and guide the conceptual thinking required.</p>

<p>He has a degree and a load of music related qualifications and we discussed what would be the best way to start a career in software development.</p>

<p>I have a degree in Computer Science, and I found it very useful, but not necessarily necessary&hellip; well depending on the desired job and in a sense that all that theory is accessible elsewhere.</p>

<p>He could go back a do a Masters degree in CS, but is the cost worth it? Maybe&hellip; but to get the most out of the year (or 2) having some programming experience would be required before hand and thats where I am helping out.</p>

<p>So, I got to thinking about what are good resources for becoming a programmer and basically ended up recommending the same resources that I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coursera &amp; MOOCs</li>
<li>Code School</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
</ul>


<p>He has also found some other reasons handy, so I will be sure to link them and his new blog when he gets round to setting it up!</p>

<h3>Meteor and DDP</h3>

<p>I must say <a href="https://www.meteor.com">meteor.js</a> and <a href="https://www.meteor.com/blog/2012/03/21/introducing-ddp">Distributed Data Protocol</a> look very interesting indeed.</p>

<p>Have watched a few <a href="https://www.meteor.com/screencast">screencasts</a>, something that is well and truly on the radar now.</p>

<h3>Whats next?</h3>

<p>I really need to prioritize thats for sure. This is quite a lot I have going on.  It blew my mind when I put it all into Trello&hellip; just too much interesting stuff and not enough hours in the day.</p>

<p>In this talk Martin defines different levels of &ldquo;Real Time&rdquo;, touching on the importance of being responsive and practical tools and advice to achieve that in the real world.</p>

<p>The talk is broken into the following sections:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to Test and Measure</li>
<li>A little bit of Theory</li>
<li>A little bit of Practice</li>
<li>Common Pitfalls</li>
<li>Useful Algorithms and Techniques</li>
</ol>
